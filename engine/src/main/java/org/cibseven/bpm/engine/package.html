    Public API of the Camunda Platform engine.<br/><br/>
    Typical usage of the API starts by the creation of a {@link org.cibseven.bpm.engine.ProcessEngineConfiguration}
    (typically based on a configuration file), from which a {@link org.cibseven.bpm.engine.ProcessEngine} can be obtained.<br/><br/>

    Through the services obtained from such a {@link org.cibseven.bpm.engine.ProcessEngine}, BPM and workflow operation
    can be executed:<br/><br/>
